In the quiet of the night, the moon shines bright.
The stars in the sky, twinkling like eyes.
The wind whispers through the trees,
Telling stories that no one sees.

In the dark, the creatures roam,
Far away from their quiet home.
The silence holds a mystery tight,
Unfolding slowly in the moonlight.

Beneath the silver glow, shadows dance,
Lost in a quiet, trance-like stance.
The night is full of secrets untold,
As the world in darkness does untold
